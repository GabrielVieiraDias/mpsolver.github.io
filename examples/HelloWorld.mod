/*
# Hello, World

This is one of the simplest MathProg models one can write. Thw `printf` statement
prints information to the model output. Note the use of `\n` to separate lines of output.

* The first statement is a comment. MathProg ignores everything on a line following
a hash tag `#`
* Every statement ends with a semicolon `;`
* The end of model is indicated by the `end;` statement.
* There is a final new line following the `end;` statement.

Experiment with this simple file. Try adding additional lines of output including
blank lines. See what happens if you leave out a needed semicolon or the final
`end;` statement.

On *MathProg Solver* you will find the output under the tab labelled Output.
